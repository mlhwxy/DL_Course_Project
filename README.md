# DL_Course_Project
These are the code files for deep learning course project submission.
My course project topic is: MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION
There are 5 prediction models in this project in seperate code files.
Model 1 (30 independent features with logistic regression and SVC models)
Model 2 (20 selected features by random forest classifier with KNN algorithm)
Model 3 (PCA to reduce the dimensionality with ANN)
Model 4 (Exploratory Data Analysis with CatBoost Classifier)
Model 5 (Financial ratios category combination with ANN)
